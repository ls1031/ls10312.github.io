This is a work in progress, but for now, we will aim to abide by it.

# General Policies

1. Small PRs: Google has a great explanation for why you should have small PRs (they call them CLs, but the same reasoning holds). You can read it [here](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html).

2. Try to maintain a turnaround of no more than a few days on PR review: see pr_policy.jpeg for a concise explanation of the "deal" regarding PR size."

3. Unless it is literally the apocalypse, do not approve your own PRs.

4. Do not edit `main` directly. Create a branch, work on it, then merge it in. Then create another branch.

5. Test everything that isn't just drawing boxes on the screen. PRs should include unit tests.

# Style (The ~~Ten~~*Eight* Commandments)

This style guide is designed to do two things: (1) avoid common sources of bugs and (2) maintain a consistent style throughout the codebase. In service of these goals, reviewers are fully within their rights to reject PRs for failing to comply with these style requirements.

1. Keep it simple, stupid. Your reviewers aren't dumb, but they are busy. Try to make code as easy to understand as possible. **Prefer readability to writability. If your code makes me go "what the fuck?", you should rewrite it.**

2. Keep your code DRY and SOLID.

3. Keep methods small (â‰¤10 lines is ideal). This applies to build methods too.

4. Everything should be `final` unless it absolutely must be mutable.

5. **Never** use the following keywords: `var`, `let`, `dynamic`. All variables must be strictly typed. ~(Small exceptions for JSON interface but we will get type safety when we shift to protobufs.)~

6. **No uninitialized variables, ever.** In objects, initialize all object members in the constructor.

7. All nontrivial literals should be `const` variables.

8. Encapsulate messy constructs. This helps with reusability, readability, and safety. Specifically, this means a few things:
- Javascript calls should be wrapped in a function and only then called. Do not have your Dart code interop directly with JS.
- API calls and queries should be (and are) wrapped in functions. Do not have backend calls intermixed with frontend presentation.
- Async work should use a FutureBuilder.

# Conventions

*This section is under construction. We will figure out how to have naming conventions of our own without pissing off Flutter, because the Flutter style is a bit shitty.*
